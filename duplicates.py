# This script checks the hash of an image to determine if its likely to be an duplicate. It will still identiy duplicates if they have been resized, and move them into a folder called duplicates

# The script in duplicates.py requires the following libraries:
    # os: For interacting with the operating system, such as navigating directories and handling file paths.
    # PIL (or Pillow): For image processing tasks.
    # imagehash: For calculating perceptual hashes of images.
    # shutil: For high-level file operations, such as moving files.
    
    # To install the above libraries run the following command
    # pip install pillow imagehash

# Change line 88 to where your photos are stored and run this script from the same directory
